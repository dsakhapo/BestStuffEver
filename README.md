# BestStuffEver
This was a programming assignment from CMPS 101 (Abstract Data Types).
This project involved implementing a hash function that used multiplicative binary hashing to generate hash values, a hash table, and singly linked lists as a way to implement chaining as a collision resolution in the hash table.

This program will read the INPUT textfile, which contains a list of userids and will hash them while also creating a unique customerid so that both the userid and customerid can be stored in a specific location in the hash table. The contents of the hash table is output to the OUTPUT textfile.

Note: A random number generator is used during the hashing processes, which results in different spots in the hash table being filled each time the program is run, and a different amount of collisions occur each time as well.
